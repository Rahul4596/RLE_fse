quad tree with explicit dictionary file-> 7.2 kb header->1.7 kb
binary tree with explicit dictionary file->6.2 kb header->1.7 kb
binary tree without explicit dictionary file->7.7 kb header->398 bytes
quad tree without explicit dictionary->7.9 kb header->436 bytes


tree split at level 8-> 6.4kb


just restricting the runlengths to 255 with a binary tree without explicit dictionary (arithmetic coding)is giving 6.4 kb, same as tree splitting at level 8.
